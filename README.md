One-liners to manage any binary.
</p>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

_sup_ is a set of simple and useful shell scripts that can be used to make your development workflow more efficient. These scripts provide one-liners that can be used to install or perform other common tasks on your binaries, and can easily be incorporated into your project's README.

_sup_ works under the following assumptions: binaries are published as [GitHub Release Assets](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/assets?apiVersion=2022-11-28) and follow the naming convention `${BIN}-${OS}-${ARCH}` (for example, `keydex-linux-amd64`). 

Optionally, programs can be accompained by a man page, whose naming convention follows manpage's `${BIN}.1`.

### Install

Executing the following command will install latest version of `mybin` (for example, downloading `mybin-linux-amd64`)

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/install | REPO=myuser/mybin sh -"
```

The name of the binary is inferred from the `REPO` variable. You can override it with `BIN`

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/install | REPO=myuser/myrepo BIN=mybin sh -"
```

### Uninstall

Same as above, but it will uninstall `mybin`

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/uninstall | REPO=myuser/mybin sh -"
```

Or, again, with the `BIN` override

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl -s https://shikaan.github.io/sup/uninstall | REPO=myuser/myrepo BIN=mybin sh -"
```
